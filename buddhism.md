Buddhism and Modern Psychology, Robert Wright
=============================================

These are my personal notes made while/after watching lectures on
Buddhism by Robert Wright.

You can check out the course
[here.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/science-of-meditatio)

Lecture 1: Introduction
=======================

The course will cover naturalistic parts of Buddhism - more
specifically, the ones that can be evaluated scientifically. The focus
will be on western Buddhism, as it typically skips the supernatural
parts, like deities etc. It cannot, however, be said that it is a
secular version of buddhism.

A psychologist, William James, has said that each religion believes in a
kind of unseen order. This is true for even the western outlook on
Buddhism, as it claims that there is an unseen order to the world, a
truth about how things work, that the humand mind was trained not to
see.

The Buddhist claim - the diagnosis - is that by aligning our minds to
these thruths, to this order, we can relieve our suffering. Is that
claim through - that is the topic of this course.

Modern psychology seems to support some of the claims. It seems that
there are some things we do not see, because that's how we were built by
natural selection.

However, it does not mean that it is impossible to change.

What Buddhism proposes are techniques, which make use of the knowledge
of these universal truths to overcome them, to "reprogram" us. (Kind of
like a rebellion against our nature.)
