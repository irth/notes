<p>These are my personal notes made while/after watching lectures on Buddhism by Robert Wright.</p>
<p>You can check out the course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/science-of-meditatio">here.</a></p>
<h1 id="lecture-1-introduction">Lecture 1: Introduction</h1>
<p>The course will cover naturalistic parts of Buddhism - more specifically, the ones that can be evaluated scientifically. The focus will be on western Buddhism, as it typically skips the supernatural parts, like deities etc. It cannot, however, be said that it is a secular version of buddhism.</p>
<p>A psychologist, William James, has said that each religion believes in a kind of unseen order. This is true for even the western outlook on Buddhism, as it claims that there is an unseen order to the world, a truth about how things work, that the humand mind was trained not to see.</p>
<p>The Buddhist claim - the diagnosis - is that by aligning our minds to these thruths, to this order, we can relieve our suffering. Is that claim through - that is the topic of this course.</p>
<p>Modern psychology seems to support some of the claims. It seems that there are some things we do not see, because that’s how we were built by natural selection.</p>
<p>However, it does not mean that it is impossible to change.</p>
<p>What Buddhism proposes are techniques, which make use of the knowledge of these universal truths to overcome them, to “reprogram” us. (Kind of like a rebellion against our nature.)</p>
